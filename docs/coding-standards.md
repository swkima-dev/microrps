# microrps coding standards

This is a short document describing the preferred coding style for this "microrps" project.
Coding style is very personal, and it may not be desirable
to impose strict coding standards on personal development projects.
However, the project aims to improve developer capabilities, especially in writing maintainable code and raising awareness of production-level quality.
Therefore, participants in this project (i.e. me) are required to follow this rule while coding.

# major principles

The following two principles are the most important in this project. All rules are governed by these two principles, and no rule can override these principles.

The purpose of these principles is not ideological, but educational and technical.

## PRINCIPLE-1) Code should be easy to understand

In other words, "code should be written to minimize the time it would take for someone else to understand it.", (Dustin et al. 2012, p3).

Every single code must be written with the idea that it will be easy for others, or your future yourself, to understand.

## PRINCIPLE-2) Prohibition of AI-assisted code generation

This project strictly prohibits the use of AI for code generation.

The following actions are explicitly forbidden:

- The use of AI agents or autonomous systems that generate code.
- Requesting AI systems to generate source code, either partially or entirely.
- Copying and pasting code generated by AI, regardless of the amount.
- Transcribing or rewriting AI-generated code (i.e., code transcription or "writing it by hand").
- Using AI-based code completion, suggestion, or inline generation tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot or similar systems).

All source code in this project must be written manually by the developer.

AI tools may be used for review, analysis, or conceptual assistance, but the act of code creation itself must be performed exclusively by the developer.

> **Note**
>
> This rule does not reflect any negative stance toward AI technologies.
> The restriction exists solely to maximize my growth as an engineer.
>
> AI systems, including coding agents, are essential tools for improving productivity in modern software development, and I hold no skepticism or ideological opposition toward their use.
> This project simply adopts a deliberate constraint to strengthen fundamental engineering skills before relying on automation.
